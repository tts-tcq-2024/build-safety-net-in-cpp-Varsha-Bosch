Test Items

The item under test is the generateSoundex function, which is responsible for converting a given name into its corresponding Soundex code.                                           

Test case1:  handling an empty string in the Soundex algorithm.
TestCase ID	TC1
Input	“”
Expected Output	""

Test case2 : Tests that a single character generates a Soundex code with the character followed by zeros.
TestCase ID	TC2
Input	"A"
Expected Output	"A000"

Test Case 3: Ensures that duplicate characters are skipped, and a valid Soundex code is generated, with proper handling of repeated sounds.
TestCase ID	TC3
Input	"AABBBB"
Expected Output	"A100"

TestCase 4: Tests that the Soundex algorithm properly handles mixed-case input, converting everything to uppercase and generating the correct Soundex code.
TestCase ID	TC4
Input	"McDonald"
Expected Output	"M235"

TestCase 5: Verifies that non-alphabetic characters are ignored in the Soundex generation and do not affect the result.
TestCase ID	TC5
Input	"John123"
Expected Output	"J500"

TestCase 6: Ensures that long input strings are processed correctly, generating the proper 4-character Soundex code.
TestCase ID	TC6
Input	“Washington”
Expected Output	"W252"

TestCase 7 : Verifies that short input strings are correctly padded with zeros to produce a 4-character Soundex code.
TestCase ID	TC7
Input	"Li"
Expected Output	"L000"

TestCase 8: Confirms that the Soundex algorithm always produces exactly four characters in the result, even when the input is longer.
TestCase ID	TC8
Input	"Ashcraft"
Expected Output	"A261"

TestCase 9 : Ensures that vowels and other characters that map to zero in Soundex are skipped correctly, with the initial character followed by zeros.
TestCase ID	TC9
Input	"AEIOU"
Expected Output	"A000"

TestCase 10: Tests that characters with the same Soundex code produce only one digit in the result, followed by zeros.
TestCase ID	TC10
Input	"BFPV"
Expected Output	"B000"

TestCase 11: Confirms that the Soundex algorithm skips characters that map to zero or are considered "silent" (e.g., 'h', 'w', 'y').
TestCase ID	TC11
Input	"Aeiouhwy"
Expected Output	"A000"
